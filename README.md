## INSTALLING THE CODE

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code so you can code along with the course.

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `14.0.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

2) Navigate to the app root folder

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.
5)  Run the app, type `ng serve` and get familiarized with the code
